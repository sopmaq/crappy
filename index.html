        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Whether you live in a suburb, on a city block, in an apartment or on a rural property, you have neighbours – and knowing your neighbours matters.</h2>
        <p>We believe that every connection you have with your neighbours makes your neighbourhood more friendly, fun and safe.  By encouraging better connected neighbourhoods and more everyday ‘neighbourliness’, neighbours can be stronger and more resilient, significantly enhancing the wellbeing of individuals, family/whanau and the wider community. We know that stronger neighbourhoods can be part of the successful antidote for many social issues within Aotearoa.
        <br /><br />
        Neighbours Day continues to be a catalyst for thousands of Kiwis to connect with their neighbours and turn their streets into neighbourhoods, ata whainga te pa harakeke.
        <blockquote>Atawhaingia te pa harakeke</blockquote>
         This whakatauki or proverb speaks to the essence of what Neighbours Day is looking to achieve, nurture familial bonds in the solidarity and unity of community. Atawhaingia is to nurture, protect, cultivate and love. The Pa Harakeke is the Harakeke (flax) grove of the village, used as a metaphor for an intertwined community.

        <h1>Why should I give a crap?</h1>
        <h2>What's so important about talking to my neighbours?</h2>
        <p>
        A resilient neighbourhood is one that’s prepared for anything – from a power outage to an earthquake.
        A resilient neighbourhood should be able to respond and recover quickly from an emergency.
        How do you know if you have one?
        Hint:
        If you tend to avoid your neighbours, you probably don’t have one!

        You know the names of your three–four closest neighbours.
        You have each other’s contact details.
        You talk to your neighbours now and then.
        People wouldn’t be afraid to ask each other for help.
        You're aware of your neighbours' children’s names and ages.
        You know the name of your neighbour’s pet.
        Street get-togethers are part of living in your neighbourhood – you have shared interests or hobbies.
        Home-grown and home-made goods are shared among your street.
        You’ve got a shared community garden or other projects.
        Why have one?
        You get to enjoy living in a safe, friendly, respectful neighbourhood.
        You get to make a difference in your local community.
        In times of loss, illness or emergency, you can help others – or be helped if you’re in need.
        How do you get one?
        Start with getting to know one another.
        Ask “how are you?”
        BBQs and baking! Share a morning tea or a barbecue a couple of times a year.
        See what you have in common– it may be that your children are the same age, you have similar hobbies, or your pets get along.
        Diversity – a diverse range of cultures, skills or knowledge can make for an exciting place to live.
        See what everyone’s strengths are and how they can be used in times of need.
